# 2.5D_renderer
My expriment with doom-like 3D renderer in VBA. It is silly, but wanted to see how far I get.

Inspired by [Recreating DOOM in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdYTvqZmyBk&list=PLi77irUVkDasNAYQPr3N8nVcJLQAlANva)
Which was inspired by [DYIDoom](https://github.com/amroibrahim/DIYDoom)

So it has been done thousends times before in many different languages.
One language I've not seen doom-like 3D renderer done in, is VBA. It should be obvious to anyone who worked with VBA why that is.
To me, its a interesting way to improve my VBA skill, regardless how useful/pleaseing the outcome will be.

At this point it's slow as hell(pun not intended), so might be worth stepping away from OOP.
